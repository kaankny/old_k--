# K-- (Programing Language)

k-- is a lightweight and flexible interpreter language. It has its own special syntax and the ability to define variables and functions. There are also standard functions available for use in the project, including basic functions like `print`, `println` and `input`.


## Features

- **Flexibility:** K-- language is extensible and modifiable, so you can customize it to suit your project.
- **Standard Functions:** With ready-made standard functions, you can start using it immediately.
- **Lightweight:** With its minimalist design and low memory consumption, it is a fast and efficient interpreter.

## How use?

Using k-- is quite simple. First, compile the source code. Then, using a text editor, write the Ghost Language codes and save them in a file with the extension ".k". Finally, run this command from the terminal or command client:

```
./kaan example.k
```

## Example Usage

### Variable Defination
```
// var type variable_name = variable_value ;

var string name = "kaan"; // declaring a variable of type string
var string surname; // declaring a variable of type string
var int age = 19; // declaring a variable of type string
```

### Variable Substitution
```
// variable_name = variable_value ;

var string name = "hello world";
name = "kaan";
```

## Funcation Call
```
// funcation_name : param1 , param2 ;

println: "hello world";
print: "hello world";
```

### Funcation Defination
```
// func funcation_name ( parameter1 , parameter2 )
// {
// } ;

func example(x)
{
  println: x;
};
```
